# Sp-R-IP

This is the repository accompanying the paper "Sp-R-IP: A Decision-Focused Learning Strategy for Linear Programs that Avoids Overfitting", submitted to ICLR 2024.

For methods minimizing the SPO+ loss function, Julia scripts were implemented, using Julia vX.X.X. For methods minimizing regret, Python scripts were implemented, using Python vX.Y.Z.
